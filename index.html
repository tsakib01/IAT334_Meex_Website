                <p>It can be very hard to find seniors who speak your language or share your interests in a multicultural community.</p>
                <p>With MeeX, you can find events that interest you and tell us about any accommodations you need.</p>
                <p>Unlike other apps, our experience is designed to be as quick, easy and accessible as possible - both in and out of the app. 
                    We offer to arrange transportation, and detailed and even translation services in several languages.</p>
                <p>Need detailed assistance? We can help with anything - just let us know when you register for events and we will make sure you are taken care of.</p>

                <h3>Led by the drive to <em>connect</em> seniors to their local communities.</h3>
                <quote>"According to the Canadian government, the population of seniors are increasing, and as a result, seniors are at risk of becoming socially isolated."</quote>
                <p>- Employment and Social Development Canada (April 14, 2022)</p>
                <p>Thinking of the problem, we saw an opportunity to help the seniors to attend activities that speak to who they are, 
                    and connect with their local communities to form lasting bonds.</p>

                <div class="desc-item1">
                    <p>We started with the roots - our local communities. 
                        We interviewed seniors and caretakers to try and understand how they socialize and to structure our design.</p>
                    <p>We then built personas based off our interviewees - to help guide our design and understand what features were needed most for the most effective results.
                         From there, we drew up our initial designs.   
                    </p>

                <div class="desc-item2">
                    <p>From there, we built out our initial prototype, consisting of a detailed onboarding process, transportation and accommodations, event registration, and more.</p>
                    <p>We decided to include transportation and accommodations into our key interaction path - the event registration flow, so that those features are front and center.
                         Under accommodations, we chose to list a few common accommodations for ease of use, but also included a text box to allow for more detailed requests.  
                    </p>
                    <p>We also included large buttons on the bottom of individual screens to more clearly indicate progression along the key interaction path for senior users.</p>

                <div class="desc-item2">
                    <p>After further feedback, we then further improved on transportation and accommodations, and added a section for emergency contacts.</p>
                    <p>We also further refined our layouts, adding icons to better distinguish information, and added venue facilities/accommodations to the event 
                        details screen so that anyone looking to register has a clear way of finding any information they need.
